## Our Mission

At SpotLabs, our mission is to empower businesses with the benefits of DeAI technology. Our simple user interface provides enterprises with tools to manage their infrastructure, storing their confidential information with utmost security while providing a large set of tools and a growing ecosystem of plugins. This new model of computation unlocks a vast variety of new possibilities, bringing AI-powered tools to the heart of enterprise infrastructure.

## How it Works

SpotLabs constitutes of a variety of plugins, also known as "Spots", that can both store encrypted sensitive company information, as well as provide AI with the ability to create and modify this data. These Spots are easily programmable, and are shared across an entire organization, allowing each member to benefit from the AI tools provided, technically proficient or not. This system allows organization members to collaborate in new ways, promoting security, efficiency and transformation. 

## Behind the Scenes

Behind the scenes, SpotLabs utilizes a LLM running locally on WebGPU. This enables us to handle user input with efficiency and security, ensuring that sensitive business data remains protected. Additionally, we leverage decentralized computing on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to store encrypted business data in a secure and decentralized manner. By combining these cutting-edge technologies, we create a robust infrastructure that enables businesses to thrive in the digital age while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security.
